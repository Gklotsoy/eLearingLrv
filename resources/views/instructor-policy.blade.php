        <h2>Notice</h2>

        <p>
            If you become an instructor on the eLearning platform, you won't be able to use the platform as a student.
            You will have access to additional features that are only available to instructors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your current courses will remain active, but you won't be able to enroll in new courses or access any student features.
            Also note that you won't be able to switch back to a student account once you become an instructor.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can always create a new account if you want to use the platform as a student again or if you want to create a new instructor account.
